![alt text](images/forkExample.png)

Go to the [GitHelper Repository](https://github.com/saehyuns/GitHelper) and fork the repository to your own account so that you have a copy of it yourself that you can modify without changing my GitHelper in my repository!

## Clone GitHelper to Local

Go to the forked repository and clone it to your local computer!

# Git Activitas 1

## Create a HelloWorld Text File

![alt text](images/activitasEx1.png)

Go to the repository on your local computer and create a text file called helloworld.txt in the Activitas1 directory!
You can choose to do this via the user interface or if you want to be cool, you can create it in the command line.
In my case..

```
cd Documents/GitHub/GitHelper/GitActivitas1
vim helloworld.txt
press 'i'
type 'Hello World!'
Press Esc and Shift + ZZ OR :w and :q
```

## Add, Commit, and Push Changes to the Remote Repository

# Git Activitas 2

## Split into groups!

## Create a Calculator.txt file

## Each person in the group branch and work on a specific function of a calculator

## Everyone merge and push to master!
